# HFDtimeseries
R scripts and data with descriptions for X paper. All raw data is deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under accession number PRJNA348350. 

16SrRNA_data
This folder contains taxonomy (16SrRNA_taxonomy.csv), a raw feature table (16S_featuretable_paper.csv), a filtered feature table, and a relative abundance table (10readsin5samples_16S_rel_abun.csv). As the file name suggests, counts were filtered to ASVs with at least 10 reads in at least 5 samples. 

Figure_1
This folder contains:
1. Figure_1.R script- This script contains the R code for creating the Salmonella Relative Abundance chart, the Lipocalin-2 boxplot, and the Respiratory Electron Acceptor Expression bar chart of Figure 1
2. Figure1_data.xlsx- The data for generating figure 1.

Figure_2
This folder contains:
1. Figure_2.R script- This script contains the R code for creating Salmonella relative abundance lineplot, the ASV barchart, and S3 expression lineplot of Figure 2.
2. Figure2_data.xlsx- The data for generating figure 2.

Figure_3
This folder contains:
1. Figure_3.R script- This script contains the R code for creating heatmap of Figure 3.
2. Figure3_data.xlsx- The data for generating figure 3.

Figure_4
This folder contains:
1. Figure_4.R script- This script contains the R code for creating NMDS with loadings, statistics for the NMDS, the volcano plot between early and peak phases, the volcano plot between peak and late phases, the donut plot between early and peak phases, and the donut plot between the peak and late phases of Figure 4.
2. Figure4_data.xlsx- The data for generating figure 4.

Figure_5
This folder contains:
1. Figure_5.R script- This script contains the R code for creating upset plot of core Salmonella genes and the boxplots of a T3SS gene (invA) and a lactate dehydrogenase (lldD) of Figure 5.
2. Figure5_data.xlsx- The data for generating figure 5.

Supplemental_figure_1
This folder contains:
1. 16Sfeaturetable_Supp_figure1.R script- This script contains the R code for creating 16S filter tables, 16S relative abundance tables, alpha diversity metrics, and statistics featured in supplemental Figure 1.
2. Supp_figure1.xlsx- The data for generating supplemental figure 1.

Supplemental_Figure_2
This folder contains:
1. Supplemental_figure_2.R script- This script contains the R code for creating metabolite boxplots of supplemental Figure 2.
